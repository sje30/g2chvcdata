# g2chvcdata


g2chvcdata: Genes to Cognition: hippocampus vs cortex dataset

# Installing this package

To install this package in R you need the devtools package; skip the
first line if you already have it installed:

	install.packages("devtools")
	devtools::install_github("sje30/g2chvcdata")

This can take a long time (at least a minute) even, on fast
connections.  On some connections (e.g. home broadband) the install
from github can take a long time.  In which case, you can install it
from zenodo.org or figshare.org **instructions to follow**.

# Downloading the data

If you just wish to use the data files, but not the R package, either
browse the files on github.com or download the package by grabbing
[master.zip](https://github.com/sje30/g2chvcdata/archive/master.zip).
